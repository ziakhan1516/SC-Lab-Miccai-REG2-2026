## 1. Docker

Grand Challenge runs your algorithm inside a **Docker container**: your code, Python dependencies, and runtime packaged together. The same image should behave the same locally and on the platform.

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Image** | What you build and upload (from a Dockerfile). |
| **Container** | One running instance of that image for a single inference job. |

The included [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) is a **sample** — it uses a PyTorch CUDA base image and installs [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt). You may replace it with another base (e.g. a slimmer Python image, conda, or your own stack) as long as the image still runs `python inference.py` as the entrypoint and includes everything your code needs at runtime.

> 🚫 **Do not put weights in the Docker image.** [`do_build.sh`](do_build.sh) builds an image from the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile), which copies **code only** — not [`model/`](model/). Do not add `COPY model/ ...` to the Dockerfile.

> ✅ **Put weights in [`model/`](model/) on disk.** Pack that folder with [`do_save.sh`](do_save.sh) into **`model.tar.gz`** and upload it under **Algorithm → Models**. At run time the platform mounts those files at `/opt/ml/model/` (section 9).

You ship **one image** that supports **both** interfaces (section 3).

---

## 2. How the container runs

For each case, the platform starts a fresh container, mounts inputs read-only at `/input`, mounts `/output` for your results, and places uploaded weights at `/opt/ml/model/`. The entrypoint runs [`inference.py`](inference.py), which writes the required output file(s) and exits. The platform reads `/output` and scores it.

In practice:

- ⚠️ **No internet** at runtime — put dependencies in the image and weights in the model tarball.
- ℹ️ **One case per run** — section 4.
- ⚠️ **Write submission results only under `/output`.**

Local runs use the same layout via [`do_build.sh`](do_build.sh), [`do_test_run.sh`](do_test_run.sh), and [`do_save.sh`](do_save.sh).

---

## 3. What is an interface?

REG2026 has two task types. Grand Challenge calls each an **interface**: a fixed contract of inputs and outputs.

| Interface | Task | Metric | Inputs | Output file |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | Visual Grounding | B | ROI thumbnail (`.jpeg`) + question (JSON) | `visual-context-response.json` |
| **1** | Workflow Reasoning | A | Whole slide image (`<uid>.tiff`, opaque UUID hash) | `chain-of-thought.json` |

Your container must implement **both**. The platform picks the interface per run (section 5); you do not branch manually.

---

## 4. One case per container start

This applies to every evaluation phase — **Debug**, **Test 1**, and **Test 2** (see [Important dates](https://reg2026.grand-challenge.org/) on the challenge site).

> ⚠️ **One container = one case.** A common mistake is assuming one container processes an entire phase in a single run. It does not.

**Example (Debug phase):** suppose that phase has **10 ROI cases** (Interface 0) and **7 WSIs** (Interface 1). The platform runs your container **17 times** in total for that phase:

1. **10 runs** for Interface 0 — each with one thumbnail, one question, and one answer in `/output`.
2. **7 runs** for Interface 1 — each with one WSI and one `chain-of-thought.json` in `/output`.

Each run is independent: new container, empty `/output`, no shared state from earlier runs.

Design accordingly:

- Load the model, infer on the single case, write output, exit.
- Model load cost is paid **every** run — keep startup reasonable.
- 🚫 Do not batch or aggregate across cases in one container.

---

## 5. Interface detection

Before your code runs, the platform writes `/input/inputs.json` with the input sockets for this case. [`core.py`](core.py) reads the slugs; [`inference.py`](inference.py) dispatches to `interf0_handler` or `interf1_handler`.

> ℹ️ You do not need to edit interface detection in `core.py` or `inference.py`.

---

## 6. Interface 0 — Visual Grounding

### Platform paths

[`inference.py`](inference.py) builds these paths and passes them into your function (do not change the paths themselves):

| Role | Path |
|---|---|
| Question | `/input/visual-context-question.json` |
| ROI thumbnail | `/input/histopathology-region-of-interest-thumbnail.jpeg` |
| Interface selector | `/input/inputs.json` (read by `core.py`) |
| Your answer | `/output/visual-context-response.json` |

### Your code

Edit [`src/interf0/model.py`](src/interf0/model.py) — function `predict_visual_context_response`:

```python
def predict_visual_context_response(
    *, question_path: Path, roi_image_path: Path
) -> str:
    ...
```

The template loads inputs with [`load_json_file`](core.py) and [`load_roi_image`](core.py) (logs file size and pixel stats to verify the ROI is not empty or corrupt), sets `device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")`, and includes a placeholder return you should replace.

> 🚫 **Do not change the return type** (`str`). `inference.py` writes it directly to `visual-context-response.json`.

### Output format

A **plain JSON string** — not an object or array:

```json
"Yes, glandular epithelium is clearly visible."
```

---

## 7. Interface 1 — Workflow Reasoning

### Platform paths

Each Interface 1 case is one whole-slide image. The platform mounts it under a **fixed directory**, but the **filename is an opaque `<uid>`** (a long UUID-style hash), not a human-readable slide name and not a generic name like `whole-slide-image.tiff`.

| Role | Path |
|---|---|
| WSI directory | `/input/images/whole-slide-image/` |
| WSI file | `/input/images/whole-slide-image/<uid>.tiff` |
| Filename in `inputs.json` | `image.name` on the `whole-slide-image` socket (e.g. `d021e460-42d8-4a72-b83e-f07050d8468a.tiff`) |
| Interface selector | `/input/inputs.json` (read by `core.py`) |
| Your chain of thought | `/output/chain-of-thought.json` |

> ℹ️ **`<uid>`** is an **anonymous platform identifier** (typically a UUID such as `d021e460-42d8-4a72-b83e-f07050d8468a`). It is **not** the original slide filename (e.g. not `PIT_01_00020_01.tiff`). [`resolve_wsi_path()`](core.py) reads `image.name` from `/input/inputs.json` and opens `/input/images/whole-slide-image/<uid>.tiff`. Do not hard-code or guess the uid in your code.

**Example layout for one case:**

```
/input/
├── inputs.json
└── images/
    └── whole-slide-image/
        └── d021e460-42d8-4a72-b83e-f07050d8468a.tiff   ← <uid>.tiff (hash varies per case)
```

### Your code

Edit [`src/interf1/model.py`](src/interf1/model.py) — function `predict_chain_of_thought`:

```python
def predict_chain_of_thought(*, wsi_path: Path) -> list[ChainOfThoughtStep]:
    ...
```

`ChainOfThoughtStep` is defined in the same file. [`inference.py`](inference.py) resolves `wsi_path` via [`resolve_wsi_path()`](core.py), then the template loads it with [`load_wsi_array`](core.py) ([tifffile](https://pypi.org/project/tifffile/)) and logs array shape, dtype, min/max/mean/std, and sample values to verify the slide is not empty or corrupt. For large slides you may use `memmap`, OpenSlide, or cuCIM in your own code; keep `wsi_path` as the entry point.

> 🚫 **Do not change the return type** (`list[ChainOfThoughtStep]`). `inference.py` writes the list directly to `chain-of-thought.json`.

[`inference.py`](inference.py) also calls `show_torch_cuda_info()` for this interface so GPU availability appears in the logs.

### Output format

A **bare JSON array** of steps. Each step:

```json
{
    "question": "...",
    "answer": "...",
    "next_question": "..."
}
```

Example:

```json
[
    {
        "question": "What type of specimen is this?",
        "answer": "The specimen is a surgically resected tissue section.",
        "next_question": "What is the predominant tissue architecture observed in this specimen?"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the predominant tissue architecture observed in this specimen?",
        "answer": "The tissue shows predominantly glandular structures.",
        "next_question": "Are there morphological features suggestive of malignancy?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Are there morphological features suggestive of malignancy?",
        "answer": "There are features including nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitotic figures.",
        "next_question": ""
    }
]
```

**Rules:**

- ⚠️ Use the **exact canonical** `question` / `next_question` strings from training annotations where the metric requires them.
- ℹ️ Last step: `"next_question": ""`.
- 🚫 Do **not** wrap the array in `{"id": ...}` — the platform adds that.

Implement inference in the `src/interf*/model.py` files or import from a package under `src/`. List any new packages in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

## 9. Model weights

Weights are **not** part of the Docker image. They live in the **[`model/`](model/)** directory in this repo and are uploaded to Grand Challenge as a **separate** `model.tar.gz` under **Algorithm → Models**. Before each run, the platform extracts that tarball to **`/opt/ml/model/`** inside the container.

| Location | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`model/`](model/) (this repo) | Development | Store checkpoints and other large files locally |
| `/opt/ml/model/` (container) | Every run | Runtime path — use `MODEL_PATH` from [`core.py`](core.py) |

**✅ Do**

- Put all checkpoints and large model assets under [`model/`](model/) (any layout you like, e.g. `model/weights.pt`, `model/my_model/config.json`).
- Load weights at runtime from `MODEL_PATH` (maps to `/opt/ml/model/`).
- Run [`do_save.sh`](do_save.sh) to build `model.tar.gz` for upload alongside the container image.

**🚫 Do not**

- Add `COPY model/ …` (or similar) to the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) — weights are provided via `model.tar.gz`, not the image.

```python
from core import MODEL_PATH

model.load_state_dict(torch.load(MODEL_PATH / "weights.pt", map_location=device))
```

For local testing, [`do_test_run.sh`](do_test_run.sh) bind-mounts [`model/`](model/) read-only to `/opt/ml/model/`, matching the platform. See [`model/README.md`](model/README.md).

---

## 10. Local testing

Run [`do_test_run.sh`](do_test_run.sh) from this directory. It:

1. Builds the image ([`do_build.sh`](do_build.sh)).
2. Mounts [`test/input/interf0/`](test/input/interf0/) and [`test/input/interf1/`](test/input/interf1/) as `/input` (same layout as the platform).
3. Runs Interface 0, then Interface 1, with no internet (GPU if available).

Keep sample cases under `test/input/interf0/` and `test/input/interf1/` in the repo. Outputs go to `test/output/` (not tracked).

**Interface 1 test fixture:** the sample WSI must be named `<uid>.tiff` under `test/input/interf1/images/whole-slide-image/`, and [`test/input/interf1/inputs.json`](test/input/interf1/inputs.json) must set the matching `image.name` (bundled example: `d021e460-42d8-4a72-b83e-f07050d8468a.tiff`). Use the same opaque hash for both the file on disk and `image.name` — not a slide basename. Do not use a fixed name like `whole-slide-image.tiff`.

Expected files after a successful run:

- [`test/output/interf0/visual-context-response.json`](test/output/interf0/visual-context-response.json)
- [`test/output/interf1/chain-of-thought.json`](test/output/interf1/chain-of-thought.json)

---

## 11. Uploading and submitting

1. Run [`do_save.sh`](do_save.sh) — produces `reg2026_algorithm_<timestamp>.tar.gz` (code image) and `model.tar.gz` (everything under [`model/`](model/)).
2. On Grand Challenge: upload the **container image** under **Algorithm → Container images** and **`model.tar.gz`** under **Algorithm → Models**.

   > 🚫 **Two separate uploads** — weights must not be embedded only in the container image.
3. Use **Try out algorithm** with sample inputs before a phase submission.
4. Submit the algorithm to the challenge phase when ready.

## 12. Fixed paths

These paths are defined in [`core.py`](core.py) and wired in [`inference.py`](inference.py).

> 🚫 **Do not change the directory layout or socket filenames** in `core.py` or `inference.py`. The WSI **basename** `<uid>.tiff` changes per case; resolve it with [`resolve_wsi_path()`](core.py), do not hard-code a single filename.

| Path | Interface | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/input/inputs.json` | Both | Interface selector |
| `/input/visual-context-question.json` | 0 | Question |
| `/input/histopathology-region-of-interest-thumbnail.jpeg` | 0 | ROI thumbnail |
| `/input/images/whole-slide-image/` | 1 | WSI directory (one file per case) |
| `/input/images/whole-slide-image/<uid>.tiff` | 1 | WSI file (`<uid>` = opaque UUID in `image.name`) |
| `/output/visual-context-response.json` | 0 | Your answer |
| `/output/chain-of-thought.json` | 1 | Your reasoning steps |
| `/opt/ml/model/` | Both | Model weights |
